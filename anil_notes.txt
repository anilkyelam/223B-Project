1. Look at all the settings file and decribe important settings 
2. JNI error due to Java version mismatch
3. Lot of effort spent in adjusting getting the resource limits right
    - too many files to set configurations
    - no facilities for fine-tuned resource allocation - lot of out of memory exceptions due to tuning errors

    - super-fragile, one change in setting causes an error in a completely unrelated place.
    - 8 hours from getting giraph built to getting the first job running without excepts
4.
