\textit{In big data analytics, balanced execution of a computation is important for maximizing 
utilization of available resources in the cluster like CPU, Memory and Network. Various
works in the past have looked at optimized execution of big data platforms like Apache 
Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark and other sort and shuffle based workloads. In this paper,
we go on a similar quest for graph processing frameworks, which are equally commonly used
in big data processing and has not been hitherto well studied. We discuss various 
factors that affect the balanced execution of a graph processing algorithms on a given 
cluster. Specifically, we focus on the effect of different graph partitioning methods 
on performance of Pagerank algorithm on a wide range of natural graphs. By both studying 
the properties of these graphs and results from the pagerank runs on Apache Giraph, we show 
that even the simplest of the partitioning schemes can have a significant effect on the 
performance.}
