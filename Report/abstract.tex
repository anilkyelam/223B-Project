\textit{In big data analytics, balanced execution of a computation is important for maximizing 
utilization of available resources in the cluster like CPU, Memory and Network. Various
works in the past have looked at optimized execution of big data platforms like Apache 
Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark and other sort and shuffle based workloads. In this paper,
we go on a similar quest for graph processing frameworks, which are equally commonly used
in big data processing. We discuss various 
factors that affect the balanced execution of a graph processing algorithm on a 
given 
cluster. Specifically, we focus on the effect of different graph partitioning 
methods 
on the performance of the PageRank algorithm on a wide variety of natural 
graphs. Surprisingly, by studying both
the properties of these graphs and results from the PageRank runs on Apache 
Giraph, we show that even quite simple partitioning algorithms have highly 
desirable qualities which can improve performance.
