\section{Conclusion}

We present a small study on the effects of partitioning algorithms on 
performance predictors (such as the distribution of edges on workers) and 
performance itself on Apache Giraph. We conclude that a tradeoff exists between 
reducing the number of messages that must be sent over the network and 
equalizing the number of edges that are distributed to each node: to optimize 
the former, range partitioning should be used, and to optimize the latter, 
modulo partitioning is best.
