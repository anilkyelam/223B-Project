\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present a study on the effects of partitioning algorithms on 
performance predictors (such as the distribution of edges on workers) and 
performance itself on Apache Giraph. We conclude that a tradeoff exists between 
reducing the number of messages that must be sent over the network and 
equalizing the number of edges that are distributed to each node: to optimize 
the former, range partitioning should be used, and to optimize the latter, 
modulo partitioning is best. However, in real-world scenarios, the partitioning 
choice matters less because its effects are masked by the overhead of setup 
that Giraph has to do.
