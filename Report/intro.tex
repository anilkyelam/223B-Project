The importance of balanced execution of big data frameworks (Papers to link: 
Osterhout\cite{Ousterhout:2015:MSP:2789770.2789791}, Themis\cite{Rasmussen:2012:TIM:2391229.2391242}, 
TritonSort\cite{Rasmussen:2013:TBE:2427631.2427634}). Traditionally, while network was a part of the 
balancing equation, the network bandwidths considered were still less than 10gbps. However, with 40g
networks becoming common and much higher bandwidths becoming available, we want to focus running 
balanced algorithms at these breakneck speeds. \\

Why we picked graph processing? Balanced sort has been well studied, there has been relatively less 
work in balanced performance for graph processing algorithms, especially at high bandwidths. \\

What we did or found out, in a nutshell.
