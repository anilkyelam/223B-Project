\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Of the features of graph processing frameworks discussed in the last section, 
we predicted input partitioning to be the one that affects the performance most 
significantly. Since we limit ourselves to vertex-centric models, 
we only focus on vertex partitioning methods. There are two potential ways in 
which the partitioning strategy can affect performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The distribution of edges across partitions} Given that the computational complexity 
    of many graph algorithms is on the order of number of edges, the share of 
    each worker in the 
    computation depends on number of edges its partition has. In order to avoid stragglers 
    (especially for synchronous coordination frameworks like Giraph), the partitioning scheme
    should distribute the edges evenly and try to minimize the variation in the number of edges 
    across partitions.
    \item \textbf{The fraction of inter-partition edges} As vertex partitioning puts vertices
    in different partitions, a lot of edges may end up with their vertices in different 
    partitions - we call these inter-partition edges. As graph algorithms work by sending 
    messages over edges, messages sent over these inter-partition edges need to 
    be sent across the network
    and add to a lot of performance overhead. A good partitioning scheme tries to minimize the 
    number of inter-partition edges. Finding such an optimal partitioning is an NP-complete problem, 
    so heuristics are required.
\end{itemize}

The partitioning heuristics can be as simple as hash-based ones that hash 
vertices into buckets 
without regard to their connectivity or complex ones that try to reduce the edge cuts across partitions 
\cite{Salihoglu1} that comes at added computational overhead of partitioning itself. Our intial goal 
was to implement a mix of simple and complex partitioning heuristics and evaluate the tradeoff between
performance benefits of good partitioning versus the overhead of partitioning itself. However, due to 
limited time and the complexity of implementing these heuristics on Apache Giraph, we restricted 
ourselves to evaluating two simple partitioning schemes that incur minimal 
computational overhead:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Round-robin (Modulo) Partitioning} In this method of 
    partitioning, we assign each vertex to 
    partition on a round-robin basis (we use the modulo operator on the vertex 
    ID to achieve this). The idea 
    is that each partition 
    should get vertices from all over the graph in a uniform way.
    \item \textbf{Range Partitioning} Here, we divide the vertex index space 
    into equal ranges where the number of ranges is the number of partitions 
    required, and vertices from each range are assigned to 
    each partition. This partitioning roughly divides the graph spatially and 
    so partitions will presumably exhibit better locality.
\end{itemize}

Since these partitioning methods are straight-forward, we first perform a theoretical analysis of our 
input graphs to see the distribution of edges in and across partitions, which is presented in the 
next section. Later, we run PageRank 
algorithm on these graphs using Giraph and analyze the running times to see if our observations 
hold in practice.
