\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

All about the graph processing frameworks and their computational models, basically 
a brief summary of \cite{Heidari:2018:SGP:3212709.3199523}. And a bunch of related 
papers we have read, like comparison papers \cite{Guo:2014:WGP:2650283.2650530,
Ammar:2018:EAD:3231751.3242935} and some earlier graph processing systems these papers 
point to - such as Pregel\cite{Malewicz:2010:PSL:1807167.1807184}, PowerGraph
\cite{Gonzalez:2012:PDG:2387880.2387883} and others.
