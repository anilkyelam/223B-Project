\section{Input Partitioning}
\label{sec:partitioning}

Here goes the partitioning choices we chose to implement, how and why for 
each of those - and what we expect in terms of resource usage.

Giraph only supports vertex partitioning, so we are limited to that for now.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Random Vertex
    \item Random edge
    \item 
\end{itemize}
